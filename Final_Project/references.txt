Project: Showcase 

References:
To develop this project, I have referred lot of websites, tutorials, YouTube videos, extensively used stack overflow for every task that I have worked on. I have faced lot of issues, errors, etc. which enabled me to research more and more. I have mentioned a few of the references, that were stored in my recent history and most of them were deleted when I upgraded my system. I have not copied the code from any source completely or as is, but have used methods, functions, syntaxes explained in the videos or tutorials to my own requirements. For every task I wanted to do, I have referred online and implemented in my own way. 
I have done the project without copying the code as is, but have referred online and used the code modified and used it as per the need. (mostly through the tutorials and stack overflow).
